# movie-meta

Welcome to the MovieMeta repository. The source files located here simply contain a browser app that queries The Movie DB API. The app comes complete with
movie titles, an overview, a rating, and a movie poster. The search bar will only query movies containing the name that you search for. For example, if
you type in the word "elf", the search will return all movies that contain the word "elf" in the movie title. And that's it! Nothing overcomplicated, I just wanted to use the API as a refresher. 

Feel free to use the source files as you wish. Just keep in mind that proper attributions to MovieDB are required, which is included on the bottom of my index.html
